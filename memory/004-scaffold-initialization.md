Context ➡️ Decision ➡️ Outcome

Context ➡️ A new GameBoy/Tokyo Night portfolio scaffold was initialized for a Bun + Astro project. The repo contains a starter layout, components, content, and basic CI skeleton.

Decision ➡️ Document the scaffold creation and list key files added so future agents and contributors have quick context. Create a README with setup, file overview, deployment notes, and verification steps. Record a memory note for repository history.

Outcome ➡️ README.md created in project root describing tech stack, local reproduction commands, file overview, deployment notes, next steps, and verification steps. Memory note created at `memory/004-scaffold-initialization.md`. The project now has clear onboarding documentation and a recorded memory for future tasks.
