# Welcome to My GameBoy Portfolio

This is the first post on my new GameBoy/Tokyo Night themed portfolio website. I've built this using Astro, Tailwind CSS, and a custom color palette that combines the classic GameBoy LCD aesthetic with the modern Tokyo Night theme.

## Design Philosophy

The design combines:
- **GameBoy Colors**: Classic green LCD palette for that retro gaming feel
- **Tokyo Night**: Dark theme with modern UI elements
- **Performance**: Static generation with Astro for lightning-fast loads
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and keyboard navigation

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Astro (static generation)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom color tokens
- **Runtime**: Bun for fast development and builds
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions

Stay tuned for more posts about my projects and development journey!
